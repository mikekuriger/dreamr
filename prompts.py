#Why we ask for this information

#To help make your dream sessions more meaningful and personalized, we ask for a few optional details like your first name, birthday, and timezone. Your first name allows the dream companion to speak to you more naturally. Your birthday helps tailor interpretations to your age and stage in life. Your timezone may help us understand your sleep patterns over time.

#None of this data is ever shared. It's only used within your dream sessions to make the experience feel more thoughtful, supportive, and human."
