./generate_img_samples.py --dream 'In this nightmare, I was stuck in some type of apartment, except it looked oddly familiar to my grandma’s house, which back then was the root of all my nightmares. I was stuck in the room with this pale, skinny entity that stood in the corner and stared at me from across there. It had short hair which I assume didn’t pass its ears and it had no lips, showing its human teeth sit nicely together like a child’s drawing. I proceeded to say we will begin the rules of the game and I couldn’t help but get the innate feeling that this has happened before. (Even though this is the only encounter I remember). It went like this, we took turns stating a rule that must be followed no matter what. After some rules I don’t remember now, it specifically said, “Don’t go out.” I don’t know why but I took this as “Don’t go out the light” as again as if I did this before. It didn’t like that. It vanished from its position with only a blink, my heart beating heavily and dreading with fear as it appeared on the TV screen. Its face was elongated with a shut mouth, except the eyes and the mouth were untouched, not correlating with the elongated face. I began repeating I’m sorry and reaffirming its rule. It then went on to scream, “I don’t think you heard me.” before the screen switch to a red background of a forest with the text, “Edgar wouldn’t go out the window.” I began screaming the name Edgar while in tears as the entity began babbling on about something in the background, a faint laughing to be heard. My heart was beating so fast that now it felt like it was being beaten on itself, as if I was striked in the chest multiple times. This is where the nightmare ended. I can provide images. But I refuse to draw the image of the entity. I don’t know who Edgar is. ' --workers 33
